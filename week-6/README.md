- [ ] **Part 6.1: Create a Web dashboard to showcase the analytical results**

  In this part, you'll be building a basic web application for the end user interaction of our project. Build a webpage using HTML, CSS and JavaScript with fields for search bar and a options to set dates for time scale in the visualisation. Also there needs to be a section for visualisations to show up, you can choose to display the visualisation by redirecting the user to next webpages or in the same page it self.
