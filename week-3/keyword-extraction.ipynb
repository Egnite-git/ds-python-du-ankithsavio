       " 'thursday december 1 2016tom hanks creepy cgi santa clauses and the theological canary in the coal mineive been making the point for a while now that the evangelical movement that i grew up with in the bible belt is radically different from the evangelical movement of today i was aware that something was changing for a while but the nature and the extent of the change crystallized for me when i read this 2004from slatenext stop bethlehemby david sarnothe polar express is the tale of a boys dreamlike train ride to the north pole to meet santa claus like all stories worth knowing its rich enough in image and feeling to accommodate many interpretations chris van allsburg the author of the book calls his story a celebration of childhood wonder and imagination william broyles jr one of the screenwriters of this years film version calls it a kind of odyssey in which a hero undertakes a mythic perilous journey of selfdiscovery and paul lauer who is a key player in the films marketing apparatus sees the polar express as a parable for the importance of faith in jesus christlauers firm motive entertainment is best known for coordinating the faithbased marketing of the passion of the christ motive helped spread early word of mouth about the filmby holding screenings for church groups and talking the movie up to religious leaders when the passion took in a stunning 370 million at the box office making it the highestgrossing rrated film in history lauer and his cohorts got a lot of the credit earlier this year motive was hired by warner bros to promote the polar express to christians but wait is the polar express an evangelical filmyoud certainly think so considering the expansive campaign of preview screenings radio promotion dvds and online resources that lauer unfurled in the christian media this fall this polar express downloads page includes endorsements from pastors and links to church and parenting resources hosted by the christian media outlet homeword there are suggestions for faithbuilding activities and a family biblestudy guide that notes for example the boys christlike struggle to get the girl a train ticket the boy risked it all to recover the ticket the guide observes jesus gave his all to save us from the penalty of our sinshomeword radio which claims to reach more than a million christian parents daily broadcast three shows promoting the film at one point the shows host wondered excitedly if the movie might turn out to be one of the more effective witnessing tools in modern times motive also produced a promotional package that was syndicated to over 100 radio stations in which christian recording artists like amy grant steven curtis chapman and avalon talked about the movie as they exited preview screeningssome audience membersand a few christian film criticswould argue that santa claus isnt necessarily a standin for jesus christ last month lauer told the mobile register that he sees the polar express as a parable not a movie about belief in god but when lauer speaks to a christian audience he tells a different story lauer told homeword radio that when he asked robert zemeckis about all the biblical parallels he was seeing in the film the director winked and said nothing in a movie this big ends up in the script by accident  zemeckis was traveling and wasnt available for commentthis is a spectacular example of getting the pertinent details of the story right and yet completely missing the point in another piece the understatement of santa claus isnt necessarily a standin for jesus christ would be sharply comic but sarno seems to be completely oblivious to the jokei know we overuse the clip of the minister gunning down santa in the middle of a childrens sermon but it illustrates an important pointover the past few years the evangelical movement has abandoned the majority of its most deeply held theological beliefs think of how doctrinal differences with catholics and even more notably mormons have been put aside it is not at all coincidental the beliefs that were abandoned were uniformly inconvenient from a political standpoint the conservative movement has both weaponized and secularized the evangelical movement with remarkable successtraditionally evangelicals were more concerned with the potential corruption of their own religion frequently to the point of paranoia than with what others were practicing christmas was a particularly hotbutton issue in the eyes of several good southern baptist ministers the holiday had become unacceptably commercial cultural rather than religious and in many ways pagan most of the music imagery and traditions had nothing to do with the nativity the reason for the season often this general hostility toward secular christmas celebrations focused on santa clauslike many religious practices the nosanta rule could look a bit silly when viewed from the outside but theres nothing unreasonable about adherents of a particular faith wanting to maintain what they see as the original meaning of a religious holiday growing up i found these attitudes and the little lectures that often accompanied them painfully annoying but even though i disagreed i could see where they were coming from from a theological standpointnow evangelicalism is a religious movement stripped of its religious elements there is no scriptural foundation for tax cuts for the rich deregulating greenhouse gases or donald trump but those are the defining issue of the movement of todayof course evangelicals are not monolithic there are many within the movement some in positions of authority who object to these obvious deviations from their original core principles there are indications that the resistance is gaining momentum and it is entirely possible that in a few years we will have to rethink our assumptions about evangelical christians and politics for now though this is a cultural social reactionary and political far right movement not a religious one and trying to think of it in any terms that these is misguided',\n",

       " 'a few weeks ago i attended nips 2015 which turned out to be by far the largest machine learning conference ever with nearly 4000 attendees the conference saw a roughly 50 increase from the previous year much of this growth seems fueled by industry interest especially in topics such as deep learning and large scale learning deep learning in particular seems to be all the rage these days at least in the public zeitgeist i think this is great for the field because this degree of interest will also percolate to the rest of machine learning more broadly there have been plenty of posts regarding nips already see sebastien bubeck neil lawrence john langford paul mineiro and hal daume with plenty of great pointers to interesting nips papers that ill hopefully get around to reading soon on my end i didnt get a chance to see too many papers in part because i was helping presenting a poster during one poster session and a demo during another but i did very much enjoy many of the talks especially during the workshopsopenaiperhaps the biggest sensation at nips was the announcement of openai which is a nonprofit artificial intelligence research company with 1b in endowment donated by people such as sam altman elon musk peter thiel and others the core ideal of openai is to promote open research in artificial intelligence for the most part not much is known about how openai will operate and from what ive gathered the people at openai havent fully decided on a strategy yet either one thing that i do know on good authority is that openai will not be patenting their research nonetheless there have already been many reactions to openai from the usual robots will steal our jobs trope to nuanced concerns voiced by machine learning expert neil lawrence observing that open access to data is just as important as open access to research and systems i do very much agree with neils point and i think that one of the best things that openai can do for the research community is to generate interesting new datasets and testbeds there have also been concerns voiced that the founding team is overwhelmingly deep learning people i dont think this is much of an issue at the moment because representation learning has been the biggest practical leap forward and giving broader access to learned representations is a great thing the announcement has even caught the attention of rationalists such as scott alexander who voiced concerns about whether ai research should be open at all for risk of losing control of the technology and potentially leading to the catastrophic results scotts concern is a metaconcern about the current mentality of ai research being an arms race and institutions such as openai not focusing on controlling access to ai that could become dangerous these metaconcerns are predicated on the assumptions that hard takeoff of agi is a legitimate existential threat to humanity which i agree with and that existing institutions such as openai could directly lead to that happening which i strongly disagree with i realize that openai ponders about humanlevel intelligence in their opening blog post but thats just a mission statement of sorts for instance google while awesome has thus far fallen quite short of their mission to organize the worlds information and make it universally accessible and useful likewise i dont expect openai to succeed in their mission statement anytime soonmost machine learning experts probably do take an overly myopic view of machine learning progress which is partly due to the aforementioned research arms race but also just due to how research works ie it is really hard to make tangible progress on something that you cant even begin to rigorously and precisely reason about however from what ive read rationalist nonexperts conversely tend to phrase things in such imprecise terms that its hard to have a substantive discussion between the two communities i imagine the truth such as it is is somewhere in the middle perhaps one should gather both camps together for a common discussionwhat is definitely going to happen in the near term is that access to ai technologies will be an increasingly important competitive advantage moving forward and its great that institutions such as openai will help promote open access to those technologiesi am optimistic that the crew at openai will explore alternative mechanisms in contrast to nsfstyle funding of research and how places like the allen institute engages in research i think itll be exciting to see what comes out of that process hopefully openai will also engage with places like the future of humanity institute and maybe even create forums that bring together people like stuart russell eric horvitz scott alexander and eliezer yudkowskycynthia dwork on universal adaptive data analysiscynthia dwork gave a great talk on using differential privacy to guard against overfitting when reusing a validation set multiple times see this science paper for more details the basic idea is that when you use your validation set to evaluate the performance of a model do so in a differentially private way so that you dont overfit to the idiosyncrasies of the validation set see for instance this paper describing an application to kagglestyle competitions this result demonstrates a great instance of unexpected convergence between different areas of study privacypreserving computation and machine learningjerry zhu on machine teachingjerry zhu has been doing very interesting work on machine teaching which he talked about at the nips workshop on adaptive machine learning roughly speaking machine teaching is the computational and statistical problem of how to select training examples to teach a learner as quickly as possible one can think of machine teaching as the converse of active learning where instead of the learner actively querying for training examples a teacher actively provides them machine teaching has a wide range of applications but the one that im most interested in is when the learner is a human as models become necessarily more complex in the quest for predictive accuracy it is important that we devise methods to keep these models somehow interpretable to humans one way is to use a machine teaching approach to quickly show the human what concepts the trained model has learned for instance this approach would have applications debugging complicated machine learning modelsrich caruana on interpretable machine learning for health careon the flip side rich carauna talked about training models that are inherently interpretable by domain experts such as medical professionals of course these models are only applicable in restricted domains such as when there is a sufficient set of handcrafted features such that a generalized additive model can accurately capture the phenomenon of interest the approach was applied to two settings predicting the risk of pneumonia and 30day readmission one interesting consequence of this study was that these interpretable models could be used to tease out biases in the data collection process for instance the model predicted that patients with asthma are at lower risk of dying from pneumonia consulting with medical experts revealed that historically patients with asthma are more closely monitored for signs of pneumonia and so the disease is detected much earlier than for the general populace nonetheless its clear that one wouldnt want a predictive model to predict a lower risk of pneumonia for patients with asthma  that was simply a consequence of how the historical data was collected see this paper for detailszoubin ghahramani on probabilistic modelszoubin ghahramani gave a keynote talk on probabilistic models during this deep learning craze its important keep in mind that properly quantifying uncertainty is often a critical component as well we are rarely given perfect information and so we can rarely make perfect predictions in order to make informed decisions our models should make calibrated probabilities regarding so that we can properly weigh different tradeoffs recall that

       " 'last month i attended kdd 2015 in beautiful sydney australia for those who dont know kdd is the premier international conference for applied machine learning a was that moocs have mostly abandoned the precollege demographic especially before high school in retrospect this is not too surprising in large part due to the very different requirements for primary and secondary education across different states and school districts but it does put a damper on the current mooc enthusiasm since many problems with education start much earlier than collegelessons learned from largescale ab testingron kohavi gave a keynote on lessons learned from online ab testing the most interesting aspect of his talk was just how welltuned the existing systems are one symptom of a highly tuned system is that it becomes very difficult to intuit about whether certain modifications will increase or decrease the performance of the system or have no effect for example he gave the audience a number of questions to the audience such as does increasing the description of the sponsored advertisements lead to increased overall clicks on ads basically the audience could not guess better than random so the main lesson is to basically to follow the data and dont be to emotionally tied to your own intuitions when it comes to optimizing large complex industrial systemssports analytics workshopi coorganized the 2nd workshop on largescale sports analytics i tried to get more esports into the workshop this year but alas fell a bit short thorsten did give an interesting talk that used esports data although the phenomenon he was studying was not specific to esports in many ways esports is an even better test bed for sports analytics than traditional sports because game replays track literally everythingwithin the more traditional sports regimes its clear that access to data remains a large bottleneck many professional leagues are hoarding their data like gold but sadly do not have the expertise leverage the data effectively the situation actually seems better in europe where access to tracked soccer sorry futbol games are relatively common in the us it seems like the data is only available to a select few sports analytics companies such as second spectrum im hopeful that this situation will change in the near future as the various stake holders become more comfortable with the idea that its not the raw data that has value but the processed artifacts built on top of that datainteresting papersthere were plenty of interesting research papers at kdd of which ill just list a few that i particularly liked a decision tree framework for spatiotemporal sequence prediction by taehwan kim yisong yue sarah taylor and iain matthewsill start with a shameless piece of

       " 'this is a guest post by ilya sutskever on the intuition behind deep learning as well as some very useful practical advice many thanks to ilya for such a heroic effortdeep learning is really popular these days big and small companies are getting into it and making money off it its hot there is some substance to the hype too large deep neural networks achieve the best results on speech recognition visual object recognition and several language related tasks such as machine translation and language modelingbut why whats so special about deep learning from now on we shall use the term large deep neural networks  ldnn  which is what the vaguer term deep learning mostly refers to why does it work now and how does it differ from neural networks of old finally suppose you want to train an ldnn rumor has it that its very difficult to do so that it is black magic that requires years of experience and while it is true that experience helps quite a bit the amount of trickery is surprisingly limited  one needs be on the lookout for only a small number wellknown pitfalls also there are many opensource implementations of various stateoftheart neural networks cf caffe cudacovnet torch theano which makes it much easier to learn all the details needed to make it workwhy does deep learning workit is clear that to solve hard problems we must use powerful models this statement is obvious indeed if a model is not powerful then there is absolutely no chance that it can succeed in solving a hard problem no matter how good the learning algorithm is the other necessary condition for success is that our model is trainable that too is obvious for if we cannot train our model then its power is useless  it will never amount to anything and great results will not be achieved the model will forever remain in a state of unrealized potential fortunately ldnns are both trainable and powerful why are ldnns powerfulwhen i talk about ldnns im talking about 1020 layer neural networks because this is what can be trained with todays algorithms i can provide a few ways of looking at ldnns that will illuminate the reason they can do as well as they doconventional statistical models learn simple patterns or clusters in contrast ldnns learn computation albeit a massively parallel computation with a modest number of steps indeed this is the key difference between ldnns and other statistical modelsto elaborate further it is well known that any algorithm can be implemented by an appropriate very deep circuit with a layer for each timestep of the algorithms execution  one example whats more the deeper the circuit the more expensive are the algorithms that can be implemented by the circuit in terms of runtime and given that neural networks are circuits as well deeper neural networks can implement algorithms with more steps  which is why depth  more powernb it is easy to see that a single neuron of a neural network can compute the conjunction of its inputs or the disjunction of its inputs by simply setting their connections to appropriate values surprisingly neural networks are actually more efficient than boolean circuits by more efficient i mean that a fairly shallow dnn can solve problems that require many more layers of boolean circuits for a specific example consider the highly surprising fact that a dnn with 2 hidden layer and a modest number of units can sort n nbit numbers i found the result shocking when i heard about it so i implemented a small neural network and trained it to sort 10 6bit numbers which was easy to do to my surprise it is impossible to sort n nbit numbers with a boolean circuit that has two hidden layers and that are not giganticthe reason dnns are more efficient than boolean circuits is because neurons perform a threshold operation which cannot be done with a tiny boolean circuitfinally human neurons are slow yet humans can perform lots of complicated tasks in a fraction of a second more specifically it is wellknown that a human neuron fires no more than 100 times per second this means that if a human can solve a problem in 01 seconds then our neurons have enough time to fire only 10 times  definitely not much more than that it therefore follows that a large neural network with 10 layers can do anything a human can in 01 seconds this is not scientific fact since it is conceivable that real neurons are much more powerful than artificial neurons but real neurons may also turn out to be much less powerful than artificial neurons in any event the above is certainly a plausible hypothesisthis is interesting because humans can solve many complicated perception problems in 01 seconds  for example humans can recognize the identity of an object thats in front of them recognize a face recognize an emotion and understand speech in a fraction of a second in fact if there exists even just one person in the entire world who has achieved an uncanny expertise in performing a highly complex task of some sort in a fraction of a second then this is highly convincing evidence that a large dnn could solve the same task  if only its connections are set to the appropriate values but wont the neural network need to be huge maybe but we definitely know that it wont have to be exponentially large  simply because the brain isnt exponentially large and if human neurons turn out to be noisy for example which means that many human neurons are required to implement a single realvalued operation that can be done using just one artificial neuron then the number of neurons required by our dnns to match a human after 01 seconds is greatly diminished these four arguments suggest strongly in my opinion that for a very wide variety of problems there exists a setting of the connections of a ldnn that basically solves the problem crucially the number of units required to solve these problems is far from exponential  on the contrary the number of units required is often so small that it is even possible using current hardware to train a network that achieves superhigh performance on the task of interest it is this last point which is so important and requires additional elaborationwe know that most machine learning algorithms are consistent that is they will solve the problem given enough data but consistency generally requires an exponentially large amount of data for example the nearest neighbor algorithm can definitely solve any problem by memorizing the correct answer to every conceivable input the same is true for a support vector machine  wed have a support vector for almost every possible training case for very hard problems the same is also true for a neural network with a single hidden layer if we have a neuron for every conceivable training case so that neuron fires for that training case and but not for any other then we could also learn and represent every conceivable function from inputs to outputs everything can be done given exponential resources but it is never ever going to be relevant in our limited physical universeand it is in this point that ldnns differ from previous methods we can be reasonably certain that a large but not huge ldnn will achieve good results on a surprising variety of problems that we may want to solve if a problem can be solved by a human in a fraction of a second then we have a very nonexponential superpessimistic upper bound on the size of the smallest neural network that can achieve very good performance but i must admit that it is impossible to predict whether a given problem will be solvable by a deep neural network ahead of time although it is often possible to tell whenever we know that a similar problem can be solved by an ldnn of a manageable size so thats it then given a problem such as visual object recognition all we need is to train a giant convolutional neural network with 50 layers clearly a giant convnet with 50 layers can be configured to achieve humanlevel performance on object recognition  right so we simply need to find these weights once once we do the problem is solvedlearningwhat is learning learning is the problem of finding a setting of the neural networks weights that achieves the best possible results on our training data in other words we want to push the information from the labelled data into the parameters so that the resulting neural network will solve our problem the success of deep learning hinges on a very fortunate fact that welltuned and carefullyinitialized stochastic gradient descent sgd can train ldnns on problems that occur in practice it is not a trivial fact since the training error of a neural network as a function of its weights is highly nonconvex and when it comes to nonconvex optimization we were taught that all bets are off only convex is good and nonconvex is bad and yet somehow sgd seems to be very good at training those large deep neural networks on the tasks that we care about the problem of training neural networks is nphard and in fact there exists a family of datasets such that the problem of finding the best neural network with three hidden units is nphard and yet sgd just solves it in practice this is the main pillar of deep learningwe can say fairly confidently that successful ldnn training relies on the easy correlation in the data which allows learning to bootstrap itself towards the more complicated correlations in the data i have done an experiment that seems to support this claim i found that training a neural network to solve the parity problem is hard i was able to train the network to solve parity for 25 bits 29 bits but never for 31 bits by the way i am not claiming that learning parity is impossible for over 30 bits  only that i didnt succeed in doing so now we know that parity is a highly unstable problem that doesnt have any linear correlations every linear function of the inputs is completely uncorrelated with the output which is a problem for neural networks since they are mostly linear at initialization time so perhaps i shouldve used larger initial weights i will discuss the topic of weight initialization later in the text so my hypothesis which is shared by many other scientists is that neural networks start their learning process by noticing the most blatant correlations between the input and the output and once they notice them they introduce several hidden units to detect them which enables the neural network to see more complicated correlations etc the process goes on i imagine some sort of a spectrum of correlations  both easy and hard and the network jumps from a correlation to a more complicated correlation much like an opportunistic mountain climbergeneralizationwhile it is very difficult to say anything specific about the precise nature of the optimization of neural networks except near a local minimum where everything becomes convex and uninteresting we can say something nontrivial and specific about generalizationand the thing we can say is the following in his famous 1984 paper called a theory of the learnable valiant proved roughly speaking that if you have a finite number of functions say n then every training error will be close to every test error once you have more than log n training cases by a small constant factor clearly if every training error is close to its test error then overfitting is basically impossible overfitting occurs when the gap between the training and the test error is large i am also told that this result was given in vapniks book as small exercise this theorem is easy to prove but i wont do it here but this very simple result has a genuine implication to any implementation of neural networks suppose i have a neural network with n parameters each parameter will be a float32 so a neural network is specified with 32n bits which means that we have no more than 232n distinct neural networks and probably much less this means that we wont overfit much once we have more than 32n training cases which is nice it means that its theoretically ok to count parameters whats more if we are quite confident that each weight only requires 4 bits say and that everything else is just noise then we can be fairly confident that the number of training cases will be a small constant factor of 4n rather than 32nthe conclusionif we want to solve a hard problem we probably need a ldnn which has many parameters so we need a large highquality labelled training set to make sure that it has enough information to specify all the networks connections and once we get that training set we should run sgd on it until the network solves the problem and it probably will if our neural network is large and deepwhat changed since the 80sin the old days people believed that neural networks could solve everything why couldnt they do it in the past there are several reasonscomputers were slow so the neural networks of past were tiny and tiny neural networks cannot achieve very high performance on anything in other words small neural networks are not powerfuldatasets were small so even if it was somehow magically possible to train ldnns there were no large datasets that had enough information to constrain their numerous parameters so failure was inevitablenobody knew how to train deep nets deep networks are important the current best object recognition networks have between 20 and 25 successive layers of convolutions a 2 layer neural network cannot do anything good on object recognition yet back in the day everyone was very sure that deep nets cannot be trained with sgd since that wouldve been too good to be trueits funny how science progresses and how easy it is to train deep neural networks especially in retrospectpractical adviceok so youre sold youre convinced that ldnns are the present and the future and you want to train it but rumor has it that its so hard so difficult or is it the reality is that it used to be hard but now the community has consolidated its knowledge and realized that training neural networks is easy as long as you keep the following in mind here is a summary of the communitys knowledge of whats important and what to look afterget the data make sure that you have a highquality dataset of inputoutput examples that is large representative and has relatively clean labels learning is completely impossible without such a datasetpreprocessing it is essential to center the data so that its mean is zero and so that the variance of each of its dimensions is one sometimes when the input dimension varies by orders of magnitude it is better to take the log1  x of that dimension basically its important to find a faithful encoding of the input with zero mean and sensibly bounded dimensions doing so makes learning work much better this is the case because the weights are updated by the formula change in wij propto xidldyj w denotes the weights from layer x to layer y and l is the loss function if the average value of the xs is large say 100 then the weight updates will be very large and correlated which makes learning bad and slow keeping things zeromean and with small variance simply makes everything work much betterminibatches use minibatches modern computers cannot be efficient if you process one training case at a time it is vastly more efficient to train the network on minibatches of 128 examples because doing so will result in massively greater throughput it would actually be nice to use minibatches of size 1 and they would probably result in improved performance and lower overfitting but the benefit of doing so is outweighed the massive computational gains provided by minibatches but dont use very large minibatches because they tend to work less well and overfit more so the practical recommendation is use the smaller minibatch that runs efficiently on your machine gradient normalization divide the gradient by minibatch size this is a good idea because of the following pleasant property you wont need to change the learning rate not too much anyway if you double the minibatch size or halve itlearning rate schedule start with a normalsized learning rate lr and reduce it towards the enda typical value of the lr is 01 amazingly 01 is a good value of the learning rate for a large number of neural networks problems learning rates frequently tend to be smaller but rarely much largeruse a validation set  a subset of the training set on which we dont train  to decide when to lower the learning rate and when to stop training eg when error on the validation set starts to increasea practical suggestion for a learning rate schedule if you see that you stopped making progress on the validation set divide the lr by 2 or by 5 and keep going eventually the lr will become very small at which point you will stop your training doing so helps ensure that you wont be overfitting the training data at the detriment of validation performance which happens easily and often also lowering the lr is important and the above recipe provides a useful approach to controlling via the validation setbut most importantly worry about the learning rate one useful idea used by some researchers eg alex krizhevsky is to monitor the ratio between the update norm and the weight norm this ratio should be at around 103 if it is much smaller then learning will probably be too slow and if it is much larger then learning will be unstable and will probably failweight initialization worry about the random initialization of the weights at the start of learning if you are lazy it is usually enough to do something like 002  randnnum_params a value at this scale tends to work surprisingly well over many different problems of course smaller or larger values are also worth trying if it doesnt work well say your neural network architecture is unusual andor very deep then you should initialize each weight matrix with the init_scale  sqrtlayer_width  randn in this case init_scale should be set to 01 or 1 or something like that random initialization is super important for deep and recurrent nets if you dont get it right then itll look like the network doesnt learn anything at all but we know that neural networks learn once the conditions are setfun story researchers believed for many years that sgd cannot train deep neural networks from random initializations every time they would try it it wouldnt work embarrassingly they did not succeed because they used the small random weights for the initialization which works great for shallow nets but simply doesnt work for deep nets at all when the nets are deep the many weight matrices all multiply each other so the effect of a suboptimal scale is amplifiedbut if your net is shallow you can afford to be less careful with the random initialization since sgd will just find a way to fix ityoure now informed worry and care about your initialization try many different kinds of initialization this effort will pay off if the net doesnt work at all ie never gets off the ground keep applying pressure to the random initialization its the right thing to doif you are training rnns or lstms use a hard constraint over the norm of the gradient remember that the gradient has been divided by batch size something like 15 or 5 works well in practice in my own experiments take your gradient divide it by the size of the minibatch and check if its norm exceeds 15 or 5 if it does then shrink it until it is 15 or 5 this one little trick plays a huge difference in the training of rnns and lstms where otherwise the exploding gradient can cause learning to fail and force you to use a puny learning rate like 1e6 which is too small to be usefulnumerical gradient checking if you are not using theano or torch youll be probably implementing your own gradients it is easy to make a mistake when we implement a gradient so it is absolutely critical to use numerical gradient checking doing so will give you a complete peace of mind and confidence in your code you will know that you can invest effort in tuning the hyperparameters such as the learning rate and the initialization and be sure that your efforts are channeled in the right directionif you are using lstms and you want to train them on problems with very long range dependencies you should initialize the biases of the forget gates of the lstms to large values by default the forget gates are the sigmoids of their total input and when the weights are small the forget gate is set to 05 which is adequate for some but not all problems this is the one nonobvious caveat about the initialization of the lstmdata augmentation be creative and find ways to algorithmically increase the number of training cases that are in your disposal if you have images then you should translate and rotate them if you have speech you should combine clean speech with all types of random noise etc data augmentation is an art unless youre dealing with images use common sensedropout dropout provides an easy way to improve performance its trivial to implement and theres little reason to not do it remember to tune the dropout probability and to not forget to turn off dropout and to multiply the weights by namely by 1dropout probability at test time also be sure to train the network for longer unlike normal training where the validation error often starts increasing after prolonged training dropout nets keep getting better and better the longer you train them so be patientensembling train 10 neural networks and average their predictions its a fairly trivial technique that results in easy sizeable performance improvements one may be mystified as to why averaging helps so much but there is a simple reason for the effectiveness of averaging suppose that two classifiers have an error rate of 70 then when they agree they are right but when they disagree one of them is often right so now the average prediction will place much more weight on the correct answer the effect will be especially strong whenever the network is confident when its right and unconfident when its wrongi am pretty sure that i havent forgotten anything the above 13 points cover literally everything thats needed in order to train ldnns successfullyso to summarizeldnns are powerfulldnns are trainable if we have a very fast computerso if we have a very large highquality dataset we can find the best ldnn for the taskwhich will solve the problem or at least come close to solving itthe endbut what does the future hold predicting the future is obviously hard but in general models that do even more computation will probably be very good the neural turing machine is a very important step in this direction other problems include unsupervised learning which is completely mysterious and incomprehensible in my opinion as of 8 jan 2015 learning very complicated things from data without supervision would be nice all these problems require extensive research',\n",
       " 'nips 2014 happened last week and what a great conference it was lots of great papers workshops and invited talks the nips experimentin contrast to previous years the most talked about thing from nips this year was not any new machine learning approach but rather a reviewing experiment called the nips experimentin a nutshell about 10 of submissions were reviewed independently by two sets of reviewers including two different area chairs the goal of the nips experiment was to assess to what extent reviewers agreed on acceptreject decisions the outcome of the experiment has been a challenge to interpret properly the provocative and thought provoking blog post by eric price has garnered the most attention from the broader scientific community basically one reasonable way of interpreting the nips experiment results is that of the papers accepted for publication at nips 2014 roughly half of them would be rejected if they were reviewed again by a different set of reviewers this of course highlights the degree of subjectivity and randomness likely exacerbated by suboptimal reviewing inherent in reviewing for a such a broad field as machine learningthe most common way to analyze this is from a certain viewpoint about fairness ie if we had a budget for k papers did the top k submissions get published from that standpoint the answer seems to be a resounding no no matter how you slice it one can argue about the degree of unfairness which is a much murkier subjectalternative viewpoint via regret minimizationhowever as echoed in a blog post by bert huang nips was awesome this year the poster sessions had lots of great papers and the oral presentations were good so id like to offer a different viewpoint about nips one based on regret minimization lets assume that the accepted papers that were more likely to be rejected in a second review are borderline papers seems like a reasonable assumption but perhaps there are arguments against it then had we swapped out a bunch of borderline papers with other borderline papers that got rejected would the quality of the conference have been that much betterin other words given a budget of k papers to accept what is the collective quality of k papers actually accepted versus the quality of the optimal set of k papers we shouldve accepted its conceivable that the regret on quality difference could be quite low despite the paper overlap being substantially differentone might even argue as alluded to here that longterm regret minimization ie reviewing for nips over many years requires some amount of randomness andor disagreement between reviewers otherwise there could be a more serious risk of groupthink or intellectual inbreeding that can cause the field to stagnatenot sure to what extent this viewpoint is appropriate for instance nips is also a venue by which junior researchers become established in the field having a significant amount of randomness in the reviewing process can definitely be detrimental to the morale and career prospects of junior researchers on to the actual papersthere were many great papers at nips this year here are a few that caught my eyesequence to sequence

       " 'its that time of year when junior researchers are preparing applications for academic positions one of the largest uncertainties that many people have is how to properly write a research statement that is typically part of the application package this post contains my thoughts on what a good computer science research statement should look like when applying to us and canadian universities please keep mind though that everyones research profile is different so what worked for me may not exactly work for you to be perfectly honest the research statement is not the most important part of your application package  the letters of recommendation are your letter writers are accomplished researchers in your field of study and can place your work in context as well as compare you to other researchers when they were at your current career stage whether or not a hiring committee seriously considers you for an onsite interview is largely a function of your recommendation letters and any other research reputation youve managed acquire while disseminating your work nonetheless the research statement is still important especially once the hiring committee gets down to a short list and are basically trying to figure out which of the strong candidates seem like they would be the most interesting and impactful additions to the departmentfor reference heres my research statement when i was on the job market in fall 2012 i want to emphasize a few points1 as my history teacher dr skinner would always say pithy and erudition in other words keep it short and to the point you have to optimize for the case when someone with very limited time is doing a quick read of your research statement no convoluted sentences and no long paragraphs as a general rule id say its probably too long if its more than 3 pages optimize your wording to be as concise as possible2 tell a story academics like to get excited by the potential of new research directions  after all thats why many of us chose to pursue this line of work so make sure you have an overarching vision in mind for me i chose to talk about machine learning with humans in the loop as my central theme during my onsite interviews i was repeatedly asked to describe what my nsf career proposal would look like the purpose of the question is so that the interviewer can get a sense of my research vision i quickly realized that i can just reemphasize various aspects of my research statement as my answer this also helps create a consistent image of who you are as a researcher3 dont regurgitate your cv your letter writers will do a far better job of describing your previous accomplishments than you will in your research statement trust in them to do that only describe your previous work to support the story youre trying to tell for me i used my previous work to demonstrate that machine learning with humans in the loop is both a broadly practical and an intellectually deep research area but i kept it to a bare minimum  previous work took up just under 1 page in my research statement your research statement is your one chance in your application package to describe your vision to the hiring committee dont waste it all on dwelling in the past 4 its ok to stretch the truth a little bit because youre trying to keep the research statement concise you cant accurately describe all the details of your previous work for instance when i described my prior work i did not include all the caveats that necessarily come with any such research result that is ok everyone understands that your research results have caveats people not in your area dont want to read a laundry list of assumptions and conditions that your result must be couched in and people who are interested will read your actual research papers you can explicitly highlight the more interesting limitations of your previous work when you talk about future research directions5 dont bullshit too much of course you must be somewhat speculative when youre laying out your research vision and describing future research directions but make sure that your speculations are grounded in some kind of sound reasoning the easiest way to do this is to demonstrate that youve already done some preliminary work in the future directions you want to pursue for my research statement i listed one piece of preliminary work that ive done for each future direction this is also a nice way to incorporate the more interesting peripheral parts of your cv into your research vision 6 get lots of feedback and iterate i had many great mentors and colleagues who contributed significantly in helping to sharpen the wording and focus of my research statement again not all of these points may work for everyone and im sure there are plenty of other good tips that i didnt mention examples here and here but hopefully this was useful to some best of luck everyone this is not to say that your actual accomplishments are not important if there is no substance to your work then your letter writers wont write you strong letters and your research wont have garnered you much recognition and reputation having done substantial work is assumed by default in this post',\n",

       " 'in the computer science phd world prospective students are just about wrapping up their school visits and they will soon make a decision on where to spend the next 56 years of their lives the decision can often be a difficult one and typically must be made with imperfect information conflicting advice from others and uncertainty about how to weigh the various influencing factors in my opinion the single biggest indicator of grad school success is how well you workfit with your advisor ben barres recently wrote a great article expounding on this very issue i wont bother with repeating all the great points he made but i want to emphasize some things from a computer science perspectiveits important to work with an advisor who has an exciting vision rather than just doggedly work someone whose research area matches the narrow scope of what you worked on as an undergrad keep in mind that a significant fraction of students perhaps as many as 50 switch areas after starting grad school from what they declared in their applications of course most switches are to neighboring areas that have significant overlap in the technical foundations but the lesson to take away here is that you should keep an open mind about what research you might find interesting its important to have a good working relationship with your advisor research is a very unpredictable process with a lot of highs and lows you will almost invariably hit some bumps while working with your advisor and its important to have a good rapport with your advisor when working through those bumps assessing this somewhat intangible fit can be hard to do a priori but simply talking to a potential advisor can often yield some warning signs or illuminate that theres a good match talking to other students who currently work or have previously worked with the potential advisor can also be useful but beware of students who have no first hand experience with the potential advisor  sometimes students just like to say things some professors are more hands on than others some professors like their students to work in groups while others like their students to work alone some professors want their students to take a deep dive for 12 years on a grand project while others want their students to be more focused on the next 46 month project all of these work styles can lead to successful research outcomes but it has to work for both the advisor and the student and of course some professors are more flexible to adapt their advising style to match the student than others working with the right advisor is usually more important than quibbles over funding most schools guarantee funding for phd students but if your advisor is low on funds then you may have to spend a few extra terms as a teaching assistant rather than be funded directly by your advisor as a research assistant in my opinion this is completely worth it if its for the right advisor the one caveat being that the school should have reasonable ta workloads however if your advisor is completely broke and cant fund anything including machines and travel then that can become problematicgood luck to everyone making decisions',\n",

listening to an awesome talk by daphne koller on online education and coursera in particular and meeting mark zuckerberg and learning about the new facebook ai research lab i also attended the ben taskar memorial session which while very saddening was also inspiring to myself and hopefully many others who attended ben taskar was a truly exceptional researcher and human being and it was very touching listening to his friends and collaborators talk about and celebrate his life and work ben leaves behind a wife and daughter who requires aroundtheclock care i encourage everyone who can to donate to his memorial fundedit  you can read more about my thoughts on this quora answerthe nips workshops have consistently been my favorite machine learning event over the past several years this year i was privileged to be an invited speaker at the discrete and combinatorial problems in machine learning workshop the guest of honor at the workshop was kazuo murota who gave a great overview on his work on discrete convexity slides here as was usual i jumped around between several workshops including bayesian optimization machine learning for sustainability and machine learning for clinical data and healthcare daniel russo presented a very interesting result at the bayesian optimization workshop showing a very simple way of analyzing thompson sampling based on existing analysis for ucbstyle algorithms he mainly showed results in a bayesian regret setting and i wonder if one could extend his result to show account for the full spectrum between bayesian expected regret and worstcase regret there were many great papers at nips this year more than i could get around to reading it seems like here are a few that i found particularly interestingsequential transfer in multiarmed bandit with finite set of models by mohammad azar alessandro lazaric and emma brunskill this paper shows how to use knowledge learned from previous onlinelearning problems to learn faster for new online learning problems ie transfer learning they leverage a recent result on learning tensor decompositions in order to arrive at a provably dataefficient approach such problems are particularly relevant in many online systems which need to continuously personalize to new users and domainshighdimensional gaussian process bandits by josip djolonga andreas krause and volkan cevher like the abovementioned paper this paper addresses how to transfer learning across different actions rather than focusing on sequential transfer learning like above this paper instead treats all the actions eg items and contexts eg users jointly as points in very high dimensional space this paper leverages a different result on lowrank matrix recovery ive thought about this type of approach a little while back and am really excited that the authors got this method to work one thing that kind of bugs me is that the first stage requires a very restrictive random sampling technique which makes the result less useful in practiceeluder dimension and the sample complexity of optimistic exploration by daniel russo and benjamin van roy this paper proposes a new measure of complexity for analyzing online learning problems this seems to be a refreshingly unique perspective on the problem although the relationship with more understood measures such as information gain is currently unclear but it does have the potential to help us analyze more complex prediction settingsmultitask bayesian optimization by kevin swersky jasper snoek and ryan adams this paper is very cool hyperparameter tuning is a big problem in machine learning this method proposes a way to use a smaller dataset to extrapolate likely outcomes when running a learning algorithm with a certain hyperparameter setting on the larger actual dataset the experiments show that it can offer significant speedups compared to standard approachesbig  quic sparse inverse covariance estimation for a million variables by chojui hsieh matyas sustik inderjit dhillon pradeep ravikumar and russell poldrack estimating highdimensional inverse covariance matrices is an increasingly more important problem in machine learning this method absolutely blows the competition out of the waterlearning adaptive value of information for structured prediction by david weiss and ben taskar this paper is also very cool it is essentially a metalearning algorithm that trains an adaptive policy on which features to compute for the base classifier to use for certain applications computing features can be very expensive and this paper shows how to achieve almost identical performance while using only a small fraction of the features furthermore certain features can be harmful for certain classification instances and the authors show how this method can actually predict to avoid computing such features depending on the problem instance theres a lot about this setup that i dont quite understand from a theoretical perspective but it seems very powerfullatent structured active learning by wenjie luo alex schwing and raquel urtasun active learning for structured prediction models is an important problem most active learning results address only the unstructured setting eg binary labels this issue is even more important in structured models because acquiring structured labels is typically much more expensive than binary labels the authors propose a method for actively eliciting labels on components of the full structured prediction problem thus leaving much of the structure latent one thing thats worth exploring here is a mixedinitiative approach rather than a purely systemdriven approach',\n",

       " 'i recently attended a workshop on media at the nyu center for urban science and progress many thanks to arun sundararajan and maria liakata for planning the workshop which facilitated a very interesting exchange of ideas from people in very different areasone issue that was discussed extensively during the workshop is the need for interpretable predictive models since the actual definition of interpretable is up for debate i concluded that at least for now its more useful to talk about when and why a model isnt interpretable and what problems that might causethe primary overarching usecase is when an enduser is using the model not only for superior predictive power but also for deriving insight from a large dataset or problem domain examples include investigative analysis that aims to use a predictive model for policy making debuggingbuilding a complicated predictive model for commercial purposesin both examples the decisionmaking process of the model needs to be somehow understandable at least at a high level and thus trustworthy unfortunately effective predictive models are typically very complex with potentially billions of parameters makes them difficult to interpretunderstand using conventional means ie inspecting the individual parameters for many settings one effective approach could be to explain the behavior of the model on specific problem instances rather than the model as a whole there appears to be at least two types of approaches for thissensitivity analysisone approach that foster provost mentioned at the workshop is to perform a form of sensitivity analysis to understand which alternative scenarios would cause the model predict something different for example weather patterns such as tropical storms are notoriously difficult to model and any prediction on the future behavior of such storms also come with a socalled cone of uncertainty one type of useful analysis would be to understand what factors might case the hurricane to fall within different regions of the cone of uncertainty assuming the model isnt just using simple contextfree stochastic process to explain uncertainty this type of sensitivity analysis can be done by varying the different input attributes into the model and then summarizing evaluating the likely outcomes typically analysts would do a significant chunk of this work manually which significantly limits the scalability of such techniques it would be interesting to develop automated metaanalysis algorithms that can perform largescale sensitivity analysis and summarization for large classes of predictive modelsstructured modelsanother way for models to explain or justify their predictions is to actually build such capabilities into the predictive model many prediction domains require structured models that can make complex predictions for example recent work by yun jiang use a model of hallucinated humans to understand a scene such as a room and how to predict where objects should be placed in this case the hallucinated human serves as a way for the model to explain that eg a sofa should be placed opposite of a television when analyzing any particular scene it would be interesting to develop useful ways of exposing salient aspects of the hallucinated humans which is typically referred to as a hidden or latent part of the model to the end user another example is my previous work on sentiment analysis with ainur yessenalina where we built a model to predict the sentiment of a movie review or congressional speech the model justifies its predictions by also extracting the sentiments that best explain the overall predictionthese models make the sometimes implicit assumption that for any particular problem instance a small set of factors contribute the bulk of reasoning behind the models prediction for that instance note that the set of contributing factors can vary for different problem instances such structured models are essentially modeling the data at a level of granularity that is more expressive than a simple prediction eg the likely human poses or the most opinionated sentences but also less complex than the raw data it would be interesting to develop these types of models to be more amenable to human inspection and modification',\n",
       " 'as some of you know im on the academic job market this year the whole process for me isnt over yet so i cant divulge any details regarding my situation but i wanted to talk about two issues about the academic job search that have been bothering mehead count capped by enrollmentat almost every university the tenuretrack faculty head count is moreorless capped by undergraduate enrollment or a professional school enrollment if youre looking for a job in say a business school yet the dean of every university i interviewed at told me that the primary responsibility of new tenuretrack faculty is to engage in basic researchim sure that if one thought hard enough about the issue and maybe perused some history books then one could reverse engineer how this whole situation came to be here are how things look from where i stand tenuretrack positions have historically been prestigious because of the jobsecurity and this continues to be the case the budget for tenuretrack salaries have historically been computed based on student enrollment for most schools this means primarily undergraduate enrollment its unclear to what extent tenuretrack salaries are currently paid for out of student tuition revenues but i can imagine that was the case in the past ever since the end of world war ii the us federal government has invested in basic research through funding agencies such as the national science foundation intellectual scholarship is the firstorder bit that dictates prestige in academia these days most of that is based on scientific researchnot only are tenuretrack positions few in number but most other research positions are significantly lacking by comparison in the way of salaries and benefits my sense is that its difficult to find comfortable nontenured ie soft money research positions this situation strikes me as rather odd and wrong and i definitely think that the number of comfortable positions available for basic research is too lowthe end gamepart 1 short fuse offerscandidates spend months preparing their application job search committees also spend a long time reviewing applications and interviewing shortlisted candidates yet the final few weeks of the academic job market are filled with rapidfire offers that have short fuses ie quick expiration dates for example someone i know received an offer with a oneweek deadline well before hed finished all his interviews from the schools perspective an earlydeadline offer puts pressure on candidates to make a decision part of the rationale behind this strategy is because schools typically have a list of candidates theyd like to make offers to and they often arent allowed to make many offers in parallel of course the problem with this strategy is that most candidates including myself dont like feeling pressured into making a decision that has such a large impact on our lives part 2 deadlockin the end many candidates push back on or at least they should the few schools theyre serious about claiming that they need more time to make a decision about each school there might be several plausible reasons why candidates need more time including managing added complexities to ones personal life wanting to be absolutely sure given the lifechanging nature of the decision waiting for other schools to get back to them before making a final decisionschools will typically allow deadlines to be extended if they realize that the candidate is serious about them of course knowing this fact didnt change the squirmy feeling i got when i asked for deadlines to be pushed back many candidates will get waitlisted by schools that theyd rather hear back from before making a final decision this situation arises since virtually all departments can only make a small number of outstanding offers even if theyd ideally like to make more typically the dean limits headcount based on enrollment or other factors should one of the departments outstanding offers get declined then the department is free to make a second offer hence the shortfuse deadlines from part 1 in most cases everyone is just waiting on a few candidates to make up their minds after which everything cascades and falls into place however a deadlock arises when a cycle is created candidate 1 gets an offer from school a but prefers school b candidate 2 gets an offer from school b but prefers school a school a intends to give a secondround offer to candidate 2 school b intends to give a secondround offer to candidate 1in essence both candidates get offers from their second choice which causes them to push back their deadlines indefinitely well not actually indefinitely but you get the idea given the limited amount of information sharing and cooperation between schools and candidates this type of situation can easily drag on for weeks this process is in my opinion severely flawed however its unclear if theres a good solution out there that doesnt require schools and candidates to more openly share information and cooperate in some fashion',\n",

       " 'a short review of hannah frys new book hello worldstarting wth cathy oneills weapons of math destruction theres been an onslaught of books sounding the alarm about the use of algorithms in daily life my amazon list that collects these together is even called woke cs these are all excellent books calling out the racial gender and class inequalities that algorithmic decisionmaking can and does exacerbate and the role of silicon valley in perpetuating these biases hannah frys new book hello world is not in this category not exactly anyway her take is informative as well as cautionary her book is as much an explainer of how algorithms get used in contexts ranging from justice to medicine to art as much as it is a reflection on what this algorithmically enabled world will look like from a human perspective and in that sense its a far more optimistic take on our current moment than ive read in a long time in a way its a relief ive been mired for so long in the trenches of bias and discrimination looking at the depressing and horrific ways in which algorithms are used as tools of oppression that it can be hard to remember that im a computer scientist for a reason i actually do marvel at and love the idea of computation as a metaphor as a tool and ultimately as a way to dare i say it do good in the world the book is structured around concepts power data and domains justice medicine cars crime and art after an initial explainer on how algorithms function and also how models are trained using machine learning and how data is used to fuel these algorithms she very quickly gets into specific case studies of both the good and the bad in algorithmically mediated decision making many of the case studies are from the uk and were unknown to me before this book i quite liked that its easy to focus solely on examples in the us but the uses and misuse of algorithms is global vidushi mardias article on ai policy in india has similar locallysourced examples if youre a layman looking to get a general sense of how algorithms tend to show up in decision making systems how they hold out hope for a better way of solving problems and where they might go wrong this is a great book it uses a minimum of jargon while still beiing willing to wade into the muck of false positives and false negatives in a very nice illustrative example in the section on recidivism prediction and compas and also attempting to welcome the reader into the church of bayes if youre a researcher in algorithmic fairness like me you start seeing the deeper references as well dr fry alludes to many of the larger governance issues around algorithmic decision making that were wrestling with now in the fat community are there better ways to integrate automated and human decisionmaking that takes advantage of what we are good at what happens when the systems we build start to change the world around them who gets to decide and how what level of error in a system is tolerable and who might be affected by it as a researcher i wish she had called out these issues a little more and there are places where issues she raises in the book have actually been addressed and in some cases answered by researchers while the book covers a number of different areas where algorithms might be taking hold it takes very different perspectives on the appropriateness of algorithmic decisionmaking in these domains dr fry is very clear and rightly so that criminal justice is one place where we need very strong checks and balances before we can countenance the use of any kind of algorithmic decisionmaking but i feel that maybe shes letting off the medical profession a little easy in the chapter on medicine while i agree that biology is complex enough that mlassistance might lead us to amazing new discoveries i think some caution is needed especially since theres ample evidence that the benefits of ai in medicine might only accrue to the mostly white populations that dominate the clinical trials similarly the discussion of creativity in art and what it means for an algorithm to be creative is fascinating the argument dr fry arrives at is that art is fundamentally human in how it exists in transmission  from artist to audience  and that art cannot be arrived at by accident via data science its a bold claim and of a kind with many claims about the essential humanness of certain activities that have been pulverized by advances in ai notwithstanding i find it very appealing to posit that art is essentially a human endeavour by definition but why not extend the same courtesy to the understanding of human behavior or biology algorithms in criminal justice are predicated on the belief that we can predict human behavior and how our interventions might change it we expect that algorithms can pierce the mysterious veil of biology revealing secrets about how our body works and yet the book argues not that these systems are fundamentally flawed but that precisely because of their effectiveness they need governance i for one am a lot more skeptical about the basic premise that algorithms can predict behavior to any useful degree beyond the aggregate and perhaps hari seldon might agree with me separately i found it not a little ironic in a time when facebook is constantly being yanked before the us congress cambridge analytica might have swayed us elections and brexit votes and youtube is a dumpster fire of extreme recommendations that id read a line like similarity works perfectly well for recommendation engines in the context of computer generated art the book arrives at a conclusion that i feel is just right to wit algorithms are not authorities and we should be skeptical of how they work and even when they might work the issues of governance around them are formidable but we should not run away from the potential of algorithms to truly help us and we should be trying to frame the problem away from the binary of algorithms good humans bad or humans good algorithms bad and towards a deeper investigation of how human and machine can work together i cannot read imagine that rather than exlcusively focusing our attention on designing our algorithm to adhere to some impossible standard of perfect fairness we instead designed them to facilitate redress when they inevitable erred that we put as much time and effort into ensuring that automatic systems were as easy to challenge as they are to implement without wanting to stand up and shout huzzah to be honest i could quote the entire conclusions chapter here and id still be shouting huzzah its a good book go out and buy it  you wont regret it this review refers to an advance copy of the book not the released hardcover the advance copy had a glitch

over the last several months has made me pause my heart races and my concentration fails the fact that the stories have largely focused on the workplace adds to my difficultydo i speak out tooi have shared a few stories with colleagues about things that have happened to me in school and at work but these stories have been somewhat lighthearted events that have been easy to share without outing the perpetratorsfor example i have told a story about a university employee telling me in so many words that i should be barefoot and pregnant and not in the office what i didnt share is that the same employee later that year  despite the fact that our common boss knew about this story because i did indeed report it  was awarded a best employee award how do you think that made me feel like my experience didnt matter and that such comments are condoned by our department why didnt i share that information widely because i was worried that folks would then be able to figure out who the culprit was and isnt that even worse shouldnt it be the sexist who is worried and not the woman who yet again is made to feel like she doesnt belonglet me tangent a bit for years i have not flown ostensibly i stopped flying because of the contribution to the climate crisis when i travel i go by train it takes longer but has been surprisingly pleasant and when travel takes 34 times as long you dont do it as often further reducing your carbon footprint of course that means that i dont go to conferences unless they are nearbybut when i really think about it is this really the reason i stopped going to conferences a conference i would normally go to was held nearby a few years ago and i didnt go sure i suffered a grievous injury two weeks before but i hadnt even registered i had planned to not go long before that injuryso really why do i no longer attend conferences partly i dont feel that i need to anymore now that i have tenure when i stopped attending conferences i was able to coast into tenure letter writers would remember me i essentially stopped going to conferences and workshops as soon as i possibly could back to the beginning or close toi was nervous at the first conference i attended as a graduate student one of the reasons i was nervous was that i was athletic at the time and planned on daily runs while i was attending  i was worried that it might be viewed as a waste of time my advisor who also went to the conference found out about my athleticism and suggested we run together this was a relief to me that is until we were running and he started talking about his lackluster sex life with his wife i responded by picking up the pace and feigning an illness on the remaining days on the last day of the conference we were out for dinner with a large group of people and dinner went late into the night i excused myself as i had a 4am bus to catch my advisor walked me out of the restaurant and awkwardly said something about wanting me to stay and that we should talk i stuck to leaving knowing that i needed some sleep before the long trip home the next day he said we should talk when we were back in the office honestly at the time i thought he was going to complain about my talk or my professional performance in some way i worried about it all through the weekend until we met next i brought it up at the end of our meeting asking what he wanted to talk about naively expecting professional criticism when he said i must surely know in a certain voice i knew he wasnt talking about work i feigned ignorance and he eventually brushed it off and said not to worry in the coming months he would cancel meetings and otherwise make himself unavailable after a half year i realized i wouldnt be able to be successful without having a supportive advisor and despite first planning to quit grad school found a new advisor and moved on that former advisor barely made eye contact with me for the remainder of my time in graduate schoolfast forward many years i was at a small workshop as a postdoc a senior and highly respected researcher invited me to dinner i was excited at the opportunity to make a stronger connection that would hopefully lead to a collaboration however at dinner he made it very clear that this was not professional by reaching across the table and stroking my hands repeatedly i dont even recall how i handled it perhaps i should have expected it  a grad school friend of mine had a similar and probably worse interaction with this same researcher shortly after i got to my room at the hotel my hotel room phone rang it was him he wanted to continue our conversation i did notperhaps a year later still as a postdoc i was at a party and a colleague from another university was there too at the end of the party we were alone we flirted mutually flirting led to kissing kissing led to him picking me up in a way that asserted how much stronger he is than me which led to my utter discomfort which led to me saying no stop repeatedly which he didnt listen to which led to a calculation in my head i could either resist and risk physical injury or i could submit i chose to submit without consentfor the record that is called rapefor a long while i suppressed it i pretended in my own head that it didnt happen that way that it was consensual i even tried to continue working with him  always in public places mind you the wall in my mind gradually broke down over the years until several years later we were at the same workshop where the doors of the rooms didnt have locks you could lock them from the inside but not the outside i remember worrying that he would be lurking in my room and took to making sure i knew where he was before i ventured back to sleepso why would i continue to go to workshops and conferences when that is the environment i know i will face even if i felt safe if 95 of the attendees are men how many look at me as a colleague and how many look at me as a potential score when i was going up for tenure i thought long and hard about listing the seniorandhighlyrespected researcher on a donotaskforaletter list but where would it stop do i include all the people who hit on me all the people who stared at my breasts or commented on my body all the people who i had been given clear signals that they didnt see me as a colleague and equal member of the research community but as a woman meant to be looked at hit on touched inappropriatelyshould i have quit grad school when i had the chance we all know it isnt any better in industry should i have pursued another discipline no discipline it seems is immune to sexualization of women but i think the situation is uniquely horrible in fields where there are so few women at conferences in theoretical computer science 510 of the attendees are women as a generous estimate the numbers arent in womens favor the chances that you will get hit on harassed assaulted are much higher there is a greater probability that you will be on your own in a group of men you cant escape working with men it is next to impossible to build a career when you start striking men off your list of collaborators in such a field that is not to say there arent wonderful men to work with there are many men in our field that i have worked with and turned to for advice and spent long hours with and never once had detected so much as a creepy vibe but you cant escape having to deal with the many others who arent good when you meet someone at a conference and they invite you for a drink or dinner to continue the conversation how do you know that they actually want to talk about work or at least treat you as they would any colleague how do you make that decisioni hung on until i no longer needed to go to conferences and workshops to advance my career to the stability of tenure but surely my career going forward will suffer my decision is also hard on my students who go to conferences on their own without someone to introduce them around it is hard on my students who cant for visa difficulties go to the international conferences that i am also unwilling to go to so we roll the dice on the few domestic conferences they can go toand now i am switching fields completely i went to two conferences last summer the first i brought the protective shield of my child and partner the second i basically showed up for my talk and nothing else i wasnt interested in schmoozing itll be difficult for sure to establish myself in a new field without fully participating in the expected waysis all this why i am switching fields not entirely im sure but it must have played a big role if i enjoyed conferences as much as everyone else seems to and didnt feel shy about starting new collaborations i might be too engrossed to consider reasons to leave and certainly the directions i am pursuing are lending themselves to a much greater chance of working with womenwhy am i speaking out now the metoo moment is forcing me to think about it of course but i have been thinking about this for years i hope it will be a relief to get it off my chest i have been getting on with it for long enough 1 in 5 women will deal with rape in their lifetime 1 in 5 you would think that i would hear about this from friends but i hadnt told anyone about my rape and almost no one has told me about theirs i think it would help in the very least therapeutically to talk about iti thought about publishing this somewhere anonymously as a woman in stem i considered publishing it nonanonymously but was shy to deal with the trolls i didnt want to deal with what many women who speak out about their experiences face have their life be scrutinized hear excuses being made on behalf of the predators generally have their experiences denied but i think by posting it here many people in theoretical computer science will read it rather than a few from the choir i am hoping that you will talk to each other about it that you will start thinking of ways to make our community better for others in all my years of going to conferences and workshops of all the inappropriate comments and behaviors that others have stood around and witnessed never once did any of the good ones call that behavior out or intervene maybe they did so in private but i think it needs to be made public even the good ones can do betterwhat can you dowhile you couldnt have protected me from being raped you can think about the situations we are expected to be in for our careers  at workshops in remote locations where were expected to drink and be merry after hours i hope not many of us have been raped by a colleague but even if you havent it doesnt take many instances of being hit on or touched inappropriately to begin to feel unsafei remember being at a conference and standing in a

quite bit amount trickery surprisingly limited one need lookout small number wellknown pitfall also many opensource implementation various stateoftheart neural network cf caffe cudacovnet torch theano make much easier learn detail needed make workwhy deep learning workit clear solve hard problem must use powerful model statement obvious indeed model not powerful absolutely no chance succeed solving hard problem no matter good learning algorithm necessary condition success model trainable obvious not train model power useless never amount anything great result not achieved model forever remain state unrealized potential fortunately ldnns trainable powerful ldnns powerfulwhen talk ldnns im talking 1020 layer neural network trained today algorithm provide way looking ldnns illuminate reason

perform lot complicated task fraction second specifically wellknown human neuron fire no 100 time per second mean human solve problem 01 second neuron enough time fire 10 time definitely not much therefore follows large neural network 10 layer anything human 01 second not scientific fact since conceivable real neuron much powerful artificial neuron real neuron may also turn much le powerful artificial neuron event certainly plausible hypothesisthis interesting human solve many complicated perception problem 01 second example human recognize identity object thats front recognize face

large dnn could solve task connection set appropriate value wont neural network need huge maybe definitely know wont exponentially large simply brain isnt exponentially large human neuron turn noisy

suggest strongly opinion wide variety problem exists setting connection ldnn basically solves problem crucially number unit required solve problem far exponential contrary number unit required often small even possible using current hardware train network achieves superhigh performance task interest last point important requires additional elaborationwe know machine learning algorithm consistent solve problem given enough data consistency generally requires exponentially large amount data example nearest neighbor algorithm definitely solve problem memorizing correct answer every conceivable

training data word want push information labelled data parameter resulting neural network solve problem success deep learning hinge fortunate fact welltuned carefullyinitialized stochastic gradient

yet somehow sgd seems good training large deep neural network task care problem training neural network nphard fact exists family datasets problem finding best neural network three hidden unit nphard yet sgd solves practice main pillar deep learningwe say fairly confidently successful ldnn training relies easy correlation data allows learning bootstrap towards complicated correlation data done experiment seems support claim found training neural network solve parity problem hard able train network solve parity 25 bit 29 bit never 31 bit way not claiming learning parity impossible 30 bit didnt succeed know parity highly unstable problem doesnt linear correlation every linear function input completely uncorrelated output problem neural network since mostly linear initialization time perhaps shouldve used larger initial weight discus topic weight initialization later text hypothesis shared many scientist neural network start learning process noticing blatant correlation input output notice introduce several hidden unit detect enables neural network see complicated correlation etc process go imagine sort spectrum correlation easy hard network jump correlation complicated correlation much like opportunistic mountain climbergeneralizationwhile difficult say anything specific precise nature optimization neural network except near local minimum everything becomes convex uninteresting say something nontrivial specific generalizationand thing say following famous 1984 paper called theory learnable valiant proved roughly speaking finite number function say n every training error close every test error log n training case small constant factor clearly every training error close test error overfitting basically impossible overfitting occurs gap training test error large also told result given vapniks book small exercise theorem easy prove wont simple result genuine implication implementation neural network suppose neural network n parameter parameter float32 neural network specified 32n bit mean no 232n distinct neural network probably much le mean wont overfit much 32n training case nice mean theoretically ok count parameter whats quite confident weight requires 4 bit say everything else noise fairly confident number training case small constant factor 4n rather 32nthe conclusionif want solve hard problem probably need ldnn many parameter need large highquality labelled training set make sure enough information specify network connection get training set run sgd network solves problem probably neural network large deepwhat changed since 80sin old day people believed neural network could solve everything couldnt past several reasonscomputers slow neural network past tiny tiny neural network not achieve high performance anything word

make sure highquality dataset inputoutput example large representative relatively clean label learning completely impossible without datasetpreprocessing essential center data mean zero variance dimension one sometimes input dimension varies order magnitude better take log1 x dimension basically important find faithful encoding input zero mean sensibly bounded dimension make learning work much better case weight updated formula change wij propto xidldyj w denotes weight layer x layer l loss function average value x large say 100 weight update large correlated make learning bad slow keeping thing zeromean small variance simply make everything work much betterminibatches use minibatches modern computer not efficient process one training case time vastly efficient train network minibatches 128 example result massively greater throughput would actually nice use minibatches size 1 would probably result improved performance lower overfitting benefit outweighed massive computational gain provided minibatches dont use large minibatches tend work le well overfit practical recommendation use smaller minibatch run efficiently machine gradient normalization divide gradient minibatch size good idea following pleasant property wont need change learning rate not much anyway double minibatch size halve itlearning rate schedule start normalsized learning rate lr reduce towards enda typical value lr 01 amazingly 01 good value learning rate large number neural network problem learning rate frequently tend smaller rarely much largeruse validation set subset training set dont train decide lower learning rate stop training eg error validation set start increasea practical suggestion learning rate schedule see stopped making progress validation set divide lr 2 5 keep going eventually lr become small point stop training help ensure wont overfitting training data detriment validation performance happens easily often also lowering lr important recipe provides useful approach controlling via validation setbut importantly worry learning rate one useful idea used researcher eg alex krizhevsky monitor ratio update norm weight norm ratio around 103 much smaller learning probably slow much larger learning unstable probably failweight initialization worry random initialization weight start learning lazy usually enough something like 002 randnnum_params value scale tends work surprisingly well many different problem course smaller larger value also worth trying doesnt work well say neural network architecture unusual andor deep initialize weight matrix init_scale sqrtlayer_width randn case init_scale set 01 1 something like random initialization super important deep recurrent net dont get right itll look like network doesnt learn anything know neural network learn condition setfun story researcher believed many year sgd not train deep neural network random initialization every time would try wouldnt work embarrassingly not succeed used small random weight initialization work great shallow net simply doesnt work deep net net deep many weight matrix multiply effect suboptimal scale amplifiedbut net shallow afford le careful random initialization since sgd find way fix ityoure informed worry care initialization try many different kind initialization effort pay net doesnt work ie never get ground keep applying pressure random initialization right thing doif training rnns lstms use hard constraint norm gradient remember gradient divided batch size something like 15 5 work well practice experiment take gradient divide size minibatch check norm exceeds 15 5 shrink 15 5 one little trick play huge difference training rnns lstms otherwise exploding gradient cause learning fail force use puny learning rate like 1e6 small usefulnumerical gradient checking not using theano torch youll probably implementing gradient easy make mistake implement gradient absolutely critical use numerical gradient checking give complete peace mind confidence code know invest effort tuning hyperparameters learning rate initialization sure effort channeled right directionif using lstms want train problem long range dependency initialize bias forget gate lstms large value default forget gate sigmoids total input weight small forget gate set 05 adequate not problem one nonobvious caveat initialization lstmdata augmentation creative find way algorithmically increase number training case disposal image translate rotate speech combine clean speech type random noise etc data augmentation art unless youre dealing image use common sensedropout dropout provides easy way improve performance trivial implement there little reason not remember tune dropout probability not forget turn dropout multiply weight namely 1dropout probability test time also sure train network longer unlike normal training validation error often start increasing prolonged training dropout net keep getting better better longer train patientensembling train 10 neural network average prediction fairly trivial technique result easy sizeable performance improvement one may mystified averaging help much simple reason effectiveness averaging suppose two classifier error rate 70 agree right disagree one often right average prediction place much weight correct answer effect especially strong whenever network confident right unconfident wrongi pretty sure havent forgotten anything 13 point cover literally everything thats needed order train ldnns successfullyso summarizeldnns powerfulldnns trainable fast

algorithmic game theory applied combinatorics applied probability statistic machine learning information coding theory control optimization networked system geometry processing multiresolution method molecular programmingplease apply three reference letter sent directly instructed candidate material due woman minority veteran disabled person encouraged apply  many know kept quite busy faculty job market past spring spent three month traveling almost nonstop time postdoc carnegie mellon university stimulating productive one coming close many thanks supervisor carlos krishnan well colleague collaborator cmu truly amazing place sheer scale highimpact research activityim delighted announce ive accepted assistant professor position computing mathematical science department california institute technologywhen visiting caltech drawn technical rigor well intense interdisciplinary focus permeate entire faculty instance pleasantly surprised find common ground geologist economist biologist therethis interdisciplinary culture part due caltechs extremely small size 300 faculty total fact one machine learning researcher caltech im looking forward interacting collaborating wide range researcher therehowever wont starting caltech yet starting next week spending one year disney researchfor support guidance throughout job search process hectic transitional year im much looking forward diving back research  recently attended workshop medium nyu center urban science progress many thanks arun sundararajan maria liakata planning workshop facilitated interesting exchange idea people different areasone issue discussed extensively workshop need interpretable predictive model since actual definition interpretable debate concluded least useful talk model isnt interpretable problem might causethe primary overarching usecase enduser using model not superior predictive power also deriving insight large dataset problem domain example include investigative analysis aim use predictive model policy making debuggingbuilding complicated predictive model commercial purposesin example decisionmaking process model need somehow understandable least high level thus trustworthy unfortunately effective predictive model typically complex potentially billion parameter make difficult interpretunderstand using conventional mean ie inspecting individual parameter many setting one effective approach could explain behavior model specific problem instance rather model whole appears least two type approach thissensitivity analysisone approach foster provost mentioned workshop perform form sensitivity analysis understand alternative scenario would cause model predict something different example weather pattern tropical storm notoriously difficult model prediction future behavior storm also come socalled cone uncertainty one type useful analysis would understand factor might case hurricane fall within different region cone uncertainty assuming model isnt using simple contextfree stochastic process explain uncertainty type sensitivity analysis done varying different input attribute model summarizing evaluating likely outcome typically analyst would significant chunk work manually significantly limit scalability technique would interesting develop automated metaanalysis algorithm perform largescale sensitivity analysis summarization large class predictive modelsstructured modelsanother way model explain justify prediction actually build capability predictive model many prediction domain require structured model make complex prediction example recent work yun jiang use model hallucinated human understand scene room predict object placed case hallucinated human serf way model explain eg sofa placed opposite television analyzing particular scene would interesting develop useful way exposing salient aspect hallucinated human typically referred hidden latent part model end user another example previous work sentiment analysis ainur yessenalina built model predict sentiment movie review congressional speech model justifies prediction also extracting sentiment best explain overall predictionthese model make sometimes implicit assumption particular problem instance small set factor contribute bulk reasoning behind model prediction instance note set contributing factor vary different problem instance structured model essentially modeling data level granularity expressive simple prediction eg likely human pose opinionated sentence also le complex raw data would interesting develop type model amenable human inspection

lowthe end gamepart 1 short fuse offerscandidates spend month preparing application job search committee also spend long time reviewing application interviewing shortlisted candidate yet final week academic job market filled rapidfire offer short fuse ie quick expiration date example someone know received offer oneweek deadline well hed finished interview school perspective earlydeadline offer put pressure candidate make decision part rationale behind strategy school typically list candidate theyd like make offer often arent allowed make many offer parallel course problem strategy candidate including dont like feeling pressured making decision large impact life part 2 deadlockin end many candidate push back least school theyre serious claiming need time make decision school might several plausible reason candidate need time including managing added complexity one personal life wanting absolutely sure given lifechanging nature decision waiting school get back making final decisionschools typically allow deadline extended realize candidate serious course knowing fact didnt change squirmy feeling got asked deadline pushed back many candidate get waitlisted school theyd rather hear back making final decision situation arises since virtually department make small number outstanding offer even theyd ideally like make typically dean limit headcount based enrollment factor one department outstanding offer get declined department free make second offer hence shortfuse deadline part 1 case everyone waiting candidate make mind everything cascade fall place however deadlock arises cycle created candidate 1 get offer school prefers school b candidate 2 get offer school b prefers school school intends give secondround offer candidate 2 school b intends give secondround offer candidate 1in essence candidate get offer second choice cause push back deadline indefinitely well not actually indefinitely get idea given limited amount information sharing cooperation school candidate type situation easily drag week process opinion severely flawed however unclear there good solution doesnt require school candidate openly share information cooperate

在本python抓取教程中您将学习如何在scrapy框架里用 python 写一个简单的网站抓取器 在本文中data blogger将被当作例子 scrapy一个旨在于网站中提取所需数据的开源和协作式框架它快速简单然而可扩展性强 顺便说一下如果您对抓取推特感兴趣不妨读一下这篇文章 介绍 在本教程中我们将仅使用scrapy 和 python 3 或 python 2 设计一个网站抓取器本教程有python 2 和python 3 两者的支持有无限的可能请小心有一些网站抓取是不合法的例如虽然技术上可能但使用scrapy 或其他网站抓取器来抓取领英 内容链接提取器 scrapy被用来从一个网站提取内容和链接其完成方式是以递归方式跟踪一个给定网站的所有链接 步骤1安装scrapy 按照scrapy网站我们只需要执行如下命令来安装scrapy 步骤2设置项目 现在我们将为您的项目创建目录结构如下命令是为data blogger 抓取器使用您可以把datablogger_scraper 改为您自己项目的名称 步骤3创建一个对象 下一件事是创建一个抓取目标网站内容的蜘蛛蜘蛛需要知道抓取什么数据数据可以放入一个对象在本教程中我们将抓取一个网站的内部链接一个链接被定义为一个对象有来源url 和目的url 来源url是在哪里我们可以发现链接它也有一个目的url 就是当链接被点击的时候链接可以带您浏览至何处当来源url 和目的url 都在一个网站时链接被称为内部链接 抓取对象实施 对象在itemspy被定义本项目的itemspy有如下内容 注意您能够定义任何您想要抓取的对象例如当您抓取一个关于游戏控制台的网站您能够指定一个对象游戏控制台有 vendor price release date几个属性如果你在抓取几个网站的关于音乐的信息你能够定义一个对象有像 artist release date 和 genre这样的属性在领英上您可以抓取一个有 education work 和 age属性的人 post 如何使用 python 和 scrapy 仅通过5个简单的步骤来抓取一个网站 appeared first data blogger  blog post use machine learning python predicting house
