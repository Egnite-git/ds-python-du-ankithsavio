- [ ] **Part 7.1: Django connections**

  Connect the web-application to your back-end analytics through Django. Make use of Ajax (or any other similar module) for Data exchange from Front-end to Back-end. Thoroughly check the working of the webpage in all situations, so that it won't crash or break at any given point.
  
- [ ] **Part 7.2: Use Plotly or any other Graphical visualisation tool that support Django**
  With Front-end and back-end connection is being set-up, it is crucial to choose the method of visualisation in the webpage, example to convert the Matplotlib/SeaBorn visualisation graph to image and display it over the Web-page or by passing the popularity values to Django and making use of Web visualisation tools such as Plotly to plot graphs directly on the webpage.
